# Arcren

This is my archlinux installation method based on archinstall


## Installation
- if you have a wifi, run `iwctl` then `station wlan0 connect {name of wifi}`

- `curl -L https://bit.ly/3ukVRLs > sample.json`
- `archinstall --config sample.json`

## boot phase


## TODO

- finish up extra folder and install script
- [] write readme
- [] make a video how to install
